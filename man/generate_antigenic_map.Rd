\title{Generate antigenic map}
\usage{
generate_antigenic_map(antigenic_distances, buckets = 1, spar = 0.3)
}
\arguments{
\item{antigenic_distances}{a data frame of antigenic coordinates, with
columns labelled X, Y and Strain for x coord, y coord and Strain label
respectively. Strain labels should be in the virus_key vector which is at
the top of this source code. See \code{\link{fonville_map_approx}}}

\item{buckets}{the number of epochs per year. 1 means that each year has 1
strain; 12 means that each year has 12 strains (monthly resolution)}

\item{spar}{to be passed to smooth.spline}
}
\value{
a fitted antigenic map
}
\description{
Fits a smoothing spline through a set of antigenic coordinates, and uses this
to predict antigenic coordinates for all potential infection time points
}
